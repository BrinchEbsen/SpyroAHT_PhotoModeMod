# Spyro: A Hero's Tail - Photo Mode
Code injection mod for Spyro: A Hero's Tail that lets the player pause the game and move the camera around freely while adjusting several visual settings.

It's only a sort-of photo mode, as I haven't added functionality to take pictures in the game. Instead, it is meant to be used in conjunction with an emulator to take screenshots.

Made with Composer's [code injection utility](https://github.com/C0mposer/C-Game-Modding-Utility).<br>
Pre-made  [xdelta](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/598/ files are available, but the mod can also be compiled and injected with the tool manually.
